	<h2>Safety First</h2>
		<p>Safety is our number one priority at camp. Each year, we start camp with a presentation on how to properly 
		use bows and all the other potentially dangerous equipment used at camp. We are glad to say that over the 
		many years that camp has been opperating, we have not had an activity related injury. Should an accident occur, 
		every group leader will have both a cell phone and walkie-talkie</p>
