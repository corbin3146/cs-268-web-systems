    	<h2>Safety First</h2>
    		<p>At camp, safety is a top priority. No but's and's if's about it. Camp opens with a safety discussion which covers everything you need to know to have fun 
    			in the sun(or rain) safely. Our range masters will keep a close eye on the children and will not tolerate any breach of safety. We are pleased to say 
    			that in the many years camp has been going, we have not had any activity related medical emergancy.</p>
    		<p>Should an emergency occur, each group leader has been trained to get help. Every group will have both cellphones and walketalkies to call for help. In 
    		addition, we have multiple retired and active medical professionals at camp.</p>
    	
    	<a id="archery"></a>
    	<h2>Archery</h2>
    		<p>Our ranges have a variety of cardbord, paper, and foam targets in several locations at varying distances. The range masters will be carefully observing
    		 and coordinating the firing and retrieval of arrows. No one even touches a bow untill everyone is behind the firing line.</p>
    	
    	<a id="adv-archery"></a>
    	<h2>Advanced Archery</h2>
    		<p>This group is for the older kids who brought their own bow and arrows who have some experience in archery. 
    		<b>WARNING If you dont hit the target, you will be searching the woods for your arrows, and may loose them</b> 
    		enter at your own risk. That said, everyone who opts in to advanced archery and listens to Jason's advice will leave a better archer.</p>
    	
    	<a id="bb-guns"></a>
    	<h2>BB-guns</h2>
    		<p>pew-pew. Safety glasses are mandantory. All guns, even bb guns are treated as always loaded, and precautions are taken to prevent muzzle flashing of any sort. 
    		Despite the safety lectures, Kids go nuts when they get here. There are always a wide variety of targets for you to shoot. All targets have been thuroughly rickochet 
    		tested beforehand. In the past, we have had pop cans, baloons, spooky ghosts, splatter targets and more.</p>
    	
    	<a id="slingshots"></a>
    	<h2>Slingshots</h2>
    		<p>Sling shots at archery camp are a little mit more <i>interesting</i> than the average 'Y' shaped sticks and rocks. We use wrist rockets, which are y shapd metal 
    		with a brace for your wrist and rubber tubing attached to the pouch. In addition, we use ball bearings as ammo. All this is a recipe for destroying targets. 
    		Speaking of which, we like to change the targets up a bit each year, but the lineup often includes soda cans, clay pidgeons, cardboard and more. Every year 
    		without fail the kids bring home (in ziplic bags) shards of the clay pidgeons they hit *scratches head in confusion*.</p>
    		
    	<a id="fireBuilding"></a>
    	<h2>Fire Building</h2>
    	<p>no 'boyscout water' allowed. Yep, we are going old school. The kids are tasked with building a fire. From spark to tinder to kindling, materials must be gathered,
 			from nature, prepped and lit. For a spark, we have several options from flint & steel to 9V & steel wool or a gum wrapper.</p>
 		<p>Note from the author: you guys and galls might need to be creative, when I was a camper, my group used cardboard from the trash to start a fire in the rain.</p>
    	
    	<a id="s-talking"></a>
    	<h2>S-talking</h2>
    	<p>S-talking is where one of our staff members dresses in full head to toe camo and hides in the woods. The kids have to find this person 
    		without the person hiding seeing them first. Once spotted by the staff member, the child must put a marker down and stop where they are at. This 
    		session comes with full explanation of blending into nature. Easier said than done!!! Kind of a crazy twist on hide and seek!!</p>
