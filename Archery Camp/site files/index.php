    	All 3rd grade-8th grade are accepted. The kids will develop friendships and memories that are priceless. They will come home 
    	happy, singing songs, and very proud and excited to show you the souvenirs they earned! The cost is only $45 for the whole 
    	weekend. It includes Friday-Sunday. All your child will need to bring is bathroom supplies, clothes, pillow and sleeping bag. 
    	Your child may bring their own bow, but it is not required. We supply all of the equipment and food for the whole weekend.
