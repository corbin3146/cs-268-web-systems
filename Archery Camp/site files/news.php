    	<h2>2020 camp cancelation</h2>
    	<p>To Whom it may Concern,<br>
           		I regret to inform you the 2020 Midwest Regional Archery Camp has been cancelled. We have reviewed current 
           		health and Safely recommendations for the COvid-19 on a city, county, state, and national level. The 
           		facilities we use are closed. It is our determination that cancelling this year's Camp is in the best 
           		interest and safety of our staff and attendees. If you have any questions, please email. We look forward to 
           		seeing each and every one of you next year. 
           		</p>
