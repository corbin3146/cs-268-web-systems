    	<h3>Why should I send my child to archery camp?</h3>
    	<p>If you send you child to archery camp, they will have the oportunity to learn a variety of outdoor skills. Many children pick up fire building, and are proud to 
    	start camp fires on family camping trips, showing off the skill they have learned. Other children go home and want to get a bow, bb-gun, or slingshot to further
    	develop their skills in what can become great outdoor hobbies. If nothing else, MWRAC will get your child off their electronics, and into nature for a weekend of
    	good food, fun, laughs, and frindships.</p>
